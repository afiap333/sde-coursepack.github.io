# Websites

I found the following websites particularly helpful, whether that be with respect to design, or even just Java syntax or library usage:

[Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) has a ton of excellent practical tutorials for Java code that I have found valuable in my own coding practice.

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) a great catalog for refactoring techniques and design patterns, with examples across multiple programming languages.
