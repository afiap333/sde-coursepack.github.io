# Course Materials

This broadly describes the course material. If you are an instructor wishing to use materials/assignments/exams from this course, you can reach out to Prof. McBurney at (mcburney at virginia dot edu). Please email from a verifiable institution or organization email address.

## Assignments

This course is intended to have 7 small-group (2-3 person teams) assignments. These assignments are each separate,
and students do not carry their own code over between assignments. This is because while this course is designed
to prepare students to work on projects, it is not itself a project course. The rationale for this decision is that
in project courses, if students get behind earlier, then it can often because an unsalvageable situation. We wanted to
avoid that, as this is typically a second-year (sophomore) course.

Versions of assignments will be publicly posted over the coming year or two. However, I make changes (either major or minor) to assignments every semester. As such, students should not assume the assignments they are given in their semester will match those eventually posted on this website.

## Exams

The course has 3 exams. Each exam covers a certain subset of the course.

Generally, the tests break down as follows, as well as which modules are part of that exam:

* Exams 1 - Tools of the Trade
  * Intro
  * Java
  * Testing
  * Code Quality
* Exams 2 - Design
  * Design
  * Arch
  * Patterns
* Exams 3 - Front to Back
  * GUI
  * Data
  * Exam 3 is typically cumulative of all course content, but with an emphasis on GUI and Data

Exams are available upon request from instructors. Please email from a verifiable institution or organization email address. I will not be posting past exams publicly.

## Slides

I eventually plan to include slide decks related to course materials on each page. The slide decks are nearly finalized, but I am planning to edit/change/expand them for Fall 2023. However, you may contact me if you wish to see my current slide deck.

## Lecture Videos

A long-term goal is to record videos for each lesson that will be embedded within the website for most articles. However, these videos will be intended to **supplement** the reading, **not replace the reading**. Students are warned that there will be content in the reading not covered in the videos that they will be responsible for.
