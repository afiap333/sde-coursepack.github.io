# Common Controls and Panes

In this module, I'm going to look at some common widgets and panes. This will include showing their use. Think of this article as more of a reference, rather than something you will be expected to know inside and out. Of course, there are far more controls/panes than I can cover here, but this should be sufficient for building any apps you plan to build in this course.

## Controls

### TextField 

#### EventHandling with Enter
