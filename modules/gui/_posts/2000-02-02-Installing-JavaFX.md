# Installing JavaFX

In this article, I walk through installing JavaFX such that you'll be able to run JavaFX applications on your local machine. I will show a number of strategies for using JavaFX in a project.

You can find a guide for [installing and using JavaFX in IntelliJ here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Intellij). You can see how to add JavaFX to an [existing Gradle project in IntelliJ here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Intellij). Note that this requires the use of a module-info class, which we will talk about in this article.
