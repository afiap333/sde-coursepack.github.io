This page will give a short example of writing a plaintext .csv file using `BufferedWriter`. Be aware that writing to a file is considered **pre-requisite knowledge**, but this gives an example of how to use a `BufferedWriter` in Java to perform this task. There are other means of writing to a file, and you are not required to use a `BufferedWriter`.
